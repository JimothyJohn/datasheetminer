# Advanced Filter System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A comprehensive, user-friendly filtering and sorting system for the DatasheetMiner web application with three-mode filtering (Include/Exclude/Neutral), keyboard-driven attribute selection, and real-time client-side filtering.

## Key Features

### 1. Three-Mode Filter System
- **○ Neutral**: Attribute exists but is ignored (gray)
- **✓ Include**: Product MUST have this attribute/value (green)
- **✗ Exclude**: Product MUST NOT have this attribute/value (red)

Click the icon on any filter chip to cycle through modes.

### 2. Keyboard-Driven UI
- Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac) to open attribute selector
- Type to search attributes instantly
- Arrow keys (↑/↓) for navigation
- Enter to select, Escape to close
- Inspired by ChatGPT-style command palettes

### 3. Smart Attribute Selection
- Context-aware: shows only relevant attributes for selected product type
- Searchable by display name or technical key
- Visual metadata (attribute type, technical name)
- Real-time filtering as you type

### 4. Dynamic Value Editing
- Click filter chips to add/edit values
- Inline editing with instant feedback
- Support for both text and numeric values
- Optional values (check for existence vs. specific value)

### 5. Flexible Sorting
- Sort by any attribute
- Toggle between ascending/descending
- Clear sorting with one click
- Visual indicators (↑/↓)

### 6. Real-Time Filtering
- All filtering happens client-side
- Instant results as you adjust filters
- No server round-trips needed
- Smooth performance with large datasets

## Components Created

### 1. `/frontend/src/types/filters.ts`
**Purpose**: Core filter types and utilities

**Key Exports**:
- `FilterCriterion`: Single filter definition
- `FilterMode`: 'include' | 'exclude' | 'neutral'
- `SortConfig`: Sort configuration
- `AttributeMetadata`: Attribute information for UI
- `getAttributesForType()`: Get filterable attributes by product type
- `applyFilters()`: Client-side filtering logic
- `sortProducts()`: Client-side sorting logic

**Features**:
- Comprehensive attribute metadata for motors and drives
- Intelligent filtering for all data types (string, number, range, array, object)
- Nested value extraction (ValueUnit, MinMaxUnit)
- Type-safe throughout

### 2. `/frontend/src/components/AttributeSelector.tsx`
**Purpose**: Keyboard-driven attribute picker modal

**Features**:
- Real-time search with instant filtering
- Keyboard navigation (↑/↓/Enter/Escape)
- Click-outside-to-close
- Visual selection highlighting
- Smooth animations
- Scrolling keeps selected item in view

**UX Details**:
- Placeholder text guides users
- Shows attribute type and technical key
- Footer shows count of available attributes
- Hover and keyboard selection both supported

### 3. `/frontend/src/components/FilterChip.tsx`
**Purpose**: Individual filter chip with mode cycling and value editing

**Features**:
- Visual mode indicators (○ ✓ ✗)
- Click icon to cycle modes
- Inline value editing
- Remove button (×)
- Color-coded by mode (gray/green/red)
- Smooth transitions

**Interaction**:
- Click mode icon → cycle through modes
- Click value → edit inline
- Click "+ value" → add specific value
- Click × → remove filter
- Enter to save, Escape to cancel

### 4. `/frontend/src/components/FilterBar.tsx`
**Purpose**: Main filter management UI

**Features**:
- Product type selector
- Add Filter button (opens AttributeSelector)
- Sort By button (opens AttributeSelector for sorting)
- Clear All button
- Active filter chips display
- Help text explaining modes
- Keyboard shortcut hint
- Responsive layout

**Layout**:
- Top row: controls (product type, add filter, sort, clear)
- Middle: active filter chips (if any)
- Bottom: help text and keyboard shortcuts

### 5. Updated `/frontend/src/components/ProductList.tsx`
**Purpose**: Integrated filter system into product listing

**Changes**:
- Replaced simple dropdown with FilterBar component
- Added state management for filters and sorting
- Applied client-side filtering and sorting
- Added keyboard shortcut handler (Ctrl+K)
- Enhanced empty state messages
- Show filter/sort counts in summary

**Logic Flow**:
1. Load products from API (by product type)
2. Apply filters client-side → `filteredProducts`
3. Apply sorting client-side → `sortedProducts`
4. Render sorted/filtered results
5. Show count: "Showing X of Y products (N active filters)"

### 6. Updated `/frontend/src/App.css`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive styling for all new components

**Sections Added**:
- Filter Bar styles (header, controls, buttons, chips)
- Filter Chip styles (modes, inline editing, remove button)
- Attribute Selector Modal (overlay, animations, list, items)
- Product List Actions (refresh button placement)
- Product List Summary (result count with filters)

**Design Language**:
- Clean, modern, minimalistic
- Color-coded modes (green = include, red = exclude, gray = neutral)
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Keyboard focus indicators
- Responsive and mobile-friendly
- Consistent spacing and typography

## How It Works

### Filter Application Flow

```
User selects product type
    ↓
API loads all products of that type
    ↓
User adds filters via Ctrl+K
    ↓
Filters applied client-side (applyFilters)
    ↓
Results sorted client-side (sortProducts)
    ↓
Display filtered & sorted products
```

### Filter Matching Logic

**String Attributes** (e.g., manufacturer):
- Case-insensitive partial matching
- "acme" matches "ACME Motors", "Acme Corp", etc.

**Numeric Attributes** (e.g., poles, IP rating):
- Exact value matching
- Can check for existence (no value) or specific value

**Range Attributes** (e.g., voltage with min/max):
- Checks if specified value falls within range
- Example: Filter "220V" matches products with "200-240V" range

**Object Attributes** (e.g., power with value+unit):
- Extracts numeric value, ignores unit
- Example: Filter "5" matches {value: 5, unit: "HP"}

**Array Attributes** (e.g., fieldbus, control_modes):
- Matches if any array element contains search value
- Example: Filter "ethernet" matches ["EtherCAT", "EtherNet/IP"]

### Filter Mode Behavior

**Include Mode (✓)**:
- Product MUST have attribute
- If value specified, must match
- Multiple include filters = AND condition
- Example: "Rated Power ✓ 5" AND "IP Rating ✓ 65"

**Exclude Mode (✗)**:
- Product MUST NOT have attribute/value
- Removes matching products
- Example: "Manufacturer ✗ BadBrand" removes all BadBrand products

**Neutral Mode (○)**:
- Filter exists but is ignored
- Useful for temporarily disabling without removing
- Example: Keep filter around but don't apply it

### Sort Logic

- Extracts comparable values from nested objects
- Handles ValueUnit (extracts `value`)
- Handles MinMaxUnit (uses average of min/max)
- Null/undefined values sorted to end
- Direction toggle: none → asc → desc → none

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find Motors with Specific Power Range
```
1. Select "Motors Only"
2. Ctrl+K → "Rated Power" → Include mode
3. Click value → enter "5"
4. Sort by "Rated Power" descending
Result: All motors with 5+ HP, highest power first
```

### Example 2: Exclude Unwanted Options
```
1. Select "Drives Only"
2. Ctrl+K → "Manufacturer" → Exclude mode
3. Click value → enter "BrandX"
4. Ctrl+K → "Series" → Exclude mode
5. Click value → enter "OldSeries"
Result: All drives except BrandX and OldSeries
```

### Example 3: Complex Multi-Filter Search
```
1. Select "Motors Only"
2. Add "Type" filter → Include → "brushless dc"
3. Add "IP Rating" filter → Include → "65"
4. Add "Rated Voltage" filter → Include → "24"
5. Add "Manufacturer" filter → Exclude → "Competitor"
6. Sort by "Rated Torque" descending
Result: High-torque brushless DC motors, 24V, IP65,
        excluding competitor, sorted by torque
```
